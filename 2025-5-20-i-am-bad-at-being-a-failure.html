            <h1>I Am Bad at Being a Failure</h1>
<p>Since my childhood i have always feared to do something. this fear was about what people would say or think about me but also about what if i'm not ready what if i am not that good  what if i fail.</p>
<p>wasted time to think and reminisce the success i could achieve and feared the potential of losing,
and here i am BEHOLD a FAILURE ,  what i hated the most.</p>
<h2>Sabotage</h2>
<p>This line of thinking will put you at a emotional state that is so fragile a fart would break you.</p>
<p>After your tenth rejection you will be a push over that thinks has no place in world.
this will perpetuate through your life.  you try to save face and be on good behavior like a good dog that listens to every command.</p>
<p>It will show up everywhere and makes you miserable.
You will save face and save yourself from cringe but it will stops you from being comfortable in you own skin.</p>
<h2>Novelty</h2>
<p>Your knees will be shaking at the thought  of new experiences , entering a running competition would give you a heart attack (not really im trying to be funny and failing (that was so meta)). </p>
<p>If you don't take a chance you have already failed . </p>
<p>And what about learning new things , that means failing like you are a school kid. </p>
<h2>An Unjust Judge</h2>
<p>You will feel every word and every sentence coming out of your mouth, you will think every action you take has a inspector .</p>
<p>Well you are correct , you are the inspector and will always look at yourself with harsh eyes.</p>
<p>It is good to have a critical view of your skills and capabilities but in no way you should be attached to your view.</p>
<p>And best way to examine yourself is by testing, and testing means failing. so if you never test yourself you will never know who you are.</p>
<h2>Encouragement</h2>
<p>When you keep failing and failing constantly you will believe that you are a failure.
You had expectations for how things would go and those expectations were not egregious .
But reality proven even worse than what you imagined.</p>
<p>If you had problems with self esteem and fear of failure like me bouncing back from this stage will
be a nightmare.
And let me tell when you are falling NO ONE will catch you they just bring up how stupid the whole idea was.</p>
<p>You will not get any encouragements .</p>
<p>This is why you should care lees about expectations of yourself and others otherwise 
moving on and growing will be impossible.</p>
<p>"Do you know who a real loser is ? A real loser is somebody that is so afraid of not winning they don't even try. " -Little Miss Sunshine</p>
<p>i am miserable and scared and lost. and the worst part i know it and still keep at it.
don't be like me.</p>
